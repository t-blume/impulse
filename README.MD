# IMPULSE
## Integrate Public Metadata Underneath professional Library SErvices

### Quickstart

#### Mapping File
This mapping file defines which information is used for which attribute in the common data model (see Deliverable D3.1 \todo[inline]{Insert Quote}). In addition, optional attributes can be defined by the user, e.g. http://purl.org/dc/terms/language. 
Furthermore, the mapping file provides the corresponding queries. The queries can be used to identify the relevant resources in the dataset. In addition, the mandatory types of the documents and the mandatory properties are made available. The documents are filtered according to the types defined here. Documents that either has no title or authors will be skipped.
The figure shows the mapping file of the Bibo-Query.
