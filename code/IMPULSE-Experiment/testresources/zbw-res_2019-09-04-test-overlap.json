{"abstract":["The use of Building information modelling for the design and construction phase of a building has been thoroughly looked into by researchers and practitioners and there is evidence to support that it is beneficial for reducing cost, time and improving communication. Yet the potential use of BIM for the operational and management phase (Facilities management), besides maintenance schedules and equipment information and location, is still not clearly identified. The UK Government, institutional clients and major private owners are now demanding for BIM for new construction and major refurbishment but given that 70-75% of the current UK building stock will still be in use in 2050, a significant part of the existing facilities will not have an information model till the next major refurbishment, creating a major gap in the built environment. This paper presents a new framework aimed at creating information models for facilities management requiring minimal BIM skills and discusses the impact that models created for the operational stage would have on the whole life cycle of a building."],"creator_personal":[{"name":"Carbonari, Giulia"},{"name":"Stravoravdis, Spyridon"},{"name":"Gausden, Christine"}],"date":2016,"econbiz_created":"2019-08-15T12:15:10Z","econbiz_id":"10012042492","identifier_doi":["10.4018/IJ3DIM.2016010101"],"identifier_url":["http://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx?doi=10.4018/IJ3DIM.2016010101"],"isPartOf":[{"day":"01","epage":"15","issn":["2156-1702","2156-1710"],"issue":"1","month":"01","pages":"1-15","spage":"1","title":"International Journal of 3-D Information Modeling (IJ3DIM)","volume":"5","year":"2016","zdb_id":"2695770-X"}],"language":["eng"],"open_access":0,"source_id":"igiglobal-10.4018/IJ3DIM.2016010101","source_name":"zbw-res","subject_byAuthor":["BIM","Existing Buildings","Facilities Management","Information Management"],"title":"Building Information Model for Existing Buildings for Facilities Management: RetroBIM Framework","type":"article"}
{"abstract":["3D virtual building models are used to help clients reach decisions during concept and detailed design phases. However, previously published research provides evidence for discrepancies between human perception of virtual and physical spaces; thus perceiving each virtual dimension (height, width, depth) differently from its physical counterpart, with varying percentages. This can affect clients' effective decision-making during coordination if 3D virtual representations are not perceived identical to their physical equivalent. This paper discusses the impact of these discrepancies beyond the design phases and into the whole lifecycle, construction and operations. Moreover, descriptive and inferential statistical analysis provides evidence of relationships between the physical and virtual perception differences in dimension, discussing possible factors contributing to perception discrepancies affecting the individual viewer, in 2 main areas 1) 3D authoring software 2) psychophysical factors. Possible solutions are also proposed to accommodate for the discrepancy between physical and virtual spaces."],"creator_personal":[{"name":"Saleeb, Noha"}],"date":2016,"econbiz_created":"2019-08-15T12:15:10Z","econbiz_id":"10012042493","identifier_doi":["10.4018/IJ3DIM.2016010102"],"identifier_url":["http://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx?doi=10.4018/IJ3DIM.2016010102"],"isPartOf":[{"day":"01","epage":"28","issn":["2156-1702","2156-1710"],"issue":"1","month":"01","pages":"16-28","spage":"16","title":"International Journal of 3-D Information Modeling (IJ3DIM)","volume":"5","year":"2016","zdb_id":"2695770-X"}],"language":["eng"],"open_access":0,"source_id":"igiglobal-10.4018/IJ3DIM.2016010102","source_name":"zbw-res","subject_byAuthor":["3D Model Visualization","Architectural Design","Building Information Modelling","Construction Lifecycle","Space Perception","Virtual Reality","Visual Cues"],"title":"Impact of Fidelity in 3D Space Visualisation Across the Construction Asset Lifecycle","type":"article"}
{"abstract":["Nowadays, when people talk about BIM software, they refer to new constructions, made of regular elements and standard parameters. The question is: what happens when one, instead of a new building, considers an ancient or existing one? To answer this question, the possibility of using effectively the BIM process for the maintenance and the conservation of Cultural Heritage has to be evaluated. In particular, the research examines the case study of the archaeological site of the Sanctuary of Diana in Nemi (Rome), which is an important example in the National Heritage. The final product consists of a parametric model, where one can find, embedded in a database, all the information about the elements for the management of conservation projects.

{"abstract":["An increasing amount of information is packed into BIMs, with the 3D geometry serving as a central index leading to other information. The 3DIR project investigates information retrieval from such environments. Here, the 3D visualization can be exploited when formulating queries, computing the relevance of information items, or visualizing search results. The need for such a system was specified using workshops with end users. A prototype was built on a commercial BIM platform. Following an evaluation, the system was enhanced to exploit model topology. Relationships between 3D objects are used to widen the search, whereby relevant information items linked to a related 3D object (rather than linked directly to objects selected by the user) are still retrieved but ranked lower. An evaluation of the enhanced prototype demonstrates its effectiveness but highlights its added complexity. Care needs to be taken when exploiting topological relationships, but that a tight coupling between text-based retrieval and the 3D model is generally effective in information retrieval from BIMs."],"creator_personal":[{"name":"Ruikar, Kirti"},{"name":"Demian, Peter"},{"name":"Sahu, Tarun"},{"name":"Morris, Anne"}],"date":2016,"econbiz_created":"2019-08-15T12:15:10Z","econbiz_id":"10012042496","identifier_doi":["10.4018/IJ3DIM.2016010105"],"identifier_url":["http://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx?doi=10.4018/IJ3DIM.2016010105"],"isPartOf":[{"day":"01","epage":"78","issn":["2156-1702","2156-1710"],"issue":"1","month":"01","pages":"67-78","spage":"67","title":"International Journal of 3-D Information Modeling (IJ3DIM)","volume":"5","year":"2016","zdb_id":"2695770-X"}],"language":["eng"],"open_access":0,"source_id":"igiglobal-10.4018/IJ3DIM.2016010105","source_name":"zbw-res","subject_byAuthor":["3D Models","BIM","Building Information Modelling","Document Management","Information Retrieval","Topology"],"title":"Three-Dimensional Information Retrieval (3DIR): Exploiting 3D Geometry and Model Topology in Information Retrieval from BIM Environments","type":"article"}
{"abstract":["The BIM process, encompassing the use of Common Data Environments (CDEs), collaborative working and the sharing of approved, up-to-the-minute information, has revolutionized the construction industry. However, this method of delivery is something which is alien to many needing a paradigm shift in communication methods (Homayouni et al, 2010), as most are more familiar with traditional approaches such as email communication and sharing communication and sharing 'marked up' hard copies of drawings. In the technology driven world in which we live, it is important that those entering the industry from this point forward have an appreciation of this way of working.  Therefore, this paper will provide an overview of a collaborative project which has been undertaken at Ulster University to help undergraduate students become familiar with this new way of working and communicating.

{"abstract":["Building Information Modelling (BIM) refers to a new collaborative way of working, which places a digital model at the epicentre of the construction process to inform decisions during the entire lifecycle of a project. In the UK, BIM Level 2 is now a mandatory requirement for all centrally-procured government projects. This is not the case in Ireland but there is evidence that clients are driving this transition via the inclusion of Employer Information Requirements in design-phase tender documentation. This move towards BIM Level 2 poses a number of challenges as it marks a significant shift from the way a project has been traditionally procured, designed, constructed and operated. In this challenge lies an opportunity for the higher education sector to respond by developing appropriate learning opportunities, both for students and industry stakeholders. This paper will chart how a close collaboration between the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology (GMIT) and the RPS Group facilitated the development of a flexible higher education programme in BIM."],"creator_personal":[{"name":"Kelly, Mark"},{"name":"Costello, Mark"},{"name":"Nicholson, Gerard"},{"name":"O'Connor, Jim"}],"date":2016,"econbiz_created":"2019-08-15T12:15:10Z","econbiz_id":"10012042499","identifier_doi":["10.4018/IJ3DIM.2016040103"],"identifier_url":["http://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx?doi=10.4018/IJ3DIM.2016040103"],"isPartOf":[{"day":"01","epage":"54","issn":["2156-1702","2156-1710"],"issue":"2","month":"04","pages":"39-54","spage":"39","title":"International Journal of 3-D Information Modeling (IJ3DIM)","volume":"5","year":"2016","zdb_id":"2695770-X"}],"language":["eng"],"open_access":0,"source_id":"igiglobal-10.4018/IJ3DIM.2016040103","source_name":"zbw-res","subject_byAuthor":["BIM","BIM Level 2","Building Information Modelling","Education","GMIT","Pedagogy","RPS"],"title":"A Collaborative Academia-Industry Approach to Developing a Higher Education Programme in Building Information Modelling","type":"article"}
{"abstract":["Latest statistics would indicate that the policy related to Building Information Modelling (BIM) implementation is working, with awareness and usage figures for both the UK and Ireland going over the 50% mark for the first time. However, whilst these results are positive, there is a realisation that there is still a distance to travel before BIM use could be considered comprehensive. This would suggest that there is still a need for a greater number of case studies to promote collaborative working practices, the BIM process and the benefits and challenges associated with its use.

{"abstract":["The BIM paradigm, supplied by appropriate standards like IFC, became unavoidable in recent construction projects. Several applications (e.g. indoor navigation, energy analysis ...) find in it a source of information on which they can rely. However, practices reveal that BIM models are not always directly reliable for applications and the latter have to ensure the validity of the data by their own. In the case of indoor navigation, the calculations will highly rely on the IfcSpace objects describing the rooms, in addition to their spatial relationships with their surrounding components. Unfortunately, it is common to face IFC models in which IfcSpace objects contain wrong geometric and topological description. In this paper, the authors discuss the issues related to BIM models validation for indoor navigation. Furthermore, they present a method to generate valid indoor spaces in IFC models. The approach relies on the structural components of the building (walls, slabs, etc.) and uses topological operations, supported by the combinatorial map data structure, to produce watertight space volumes."],"creator_personal":[{"name":"Abou Diakité, Abdoulaye"},{"name":"Zlatanova, Sisi"}],"date":2016,"econbiz_created":"2019-08-15T12:15:10Z","econbiz_id":"10012042501","identifier_doi":["10.4018/IJ3DIM.2016070101"],"identifier_url":["http://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx?doi=10.4018/IJ3DIM.2016070101"],"isPartOf":[{"day":"01","epage":"17","issn":["2156-1702","2156-1710"],"issue":"3","month":"07","pages":"1-17","spage":"1","title":"International Journal of 3-D Information Modeling (IJ3DIM)","volume":"5","year":"2016","zdb_id":"2695770-X"}],"language":["eng"],"open_access":0,"source_id":"igiglobal-10.4018/IJ3DIM.2016070101","source_name":"zbw-res","subject_byAuthor":["Building Analysis","Building Model","GIS","IFC","IfcSpace","Simulation","Space Generation","Standard","Validation"],"title":"Valid Space Description in BIM for 3D Indoor Navigation","type":"article"}

{"abstract":["The UK government set up a BIM Task Group in 2011 to provide guidance and support to the industry. This paper reports on BIM Capability audits that were undertaken on two contractor-based organisations to assess their level of readiness to implement BIM level 2 and to highlight training and upskilling needs. The audits were undertaken using a detailed set of 80 questions covering technology, workflows, processes and business strategies. Follow up interviews were undertaken to clarify any ambiguities in the responses received.

{"abstract":["Considering the remarkable shift that the digitalisation is nowadays bringing about in the building sector, the paper focuses on how the great amount of data collected around assets is changing the way buildings are operated, particularly for what concerns innovation on products, processes and technologies. By establishing a connection between as-designed virtual models and as-delivered physical assets, the paper presents methods and tools based on information management and developed for assessing building behaviours in operation and for defining control strategies for satisfying user needs. The research aims to investigate how the building process could benefit from the availability of multi-faceted information collected in real time (e.g. through sensors) during the operational stages of buildings.

{"abstract":["The UK's construction industry is witnessing an annual increase in costs due to a lack of communication between the different organizational operators on the construction site that often leads to construction defects. Meanwhile, a cost-reduction strategy plan using BIM has become a fundamental requirement for the government, aiming to keep costs under control. To facilitate BIM adoption in the industry, the BIM strategy was introduced in four phases, with each stage entailing a number of criteria. The industry has seen a global reaction to the Level 2 BIM program and a significant cost saving of 840M in 2013/14 in Europe. However, the industry is unable to match the level 3 BIM, where a collaborative model file server is required as a common sharable platform to achieve efficient communication. This study contributes toward formulating a communication framework in the UK industry to understand communication issues and manage defects.

Although the benefits of BIM within the supply-side of the industry have been widely explored, its impact on the value for clients and end-users has been researched in a limited manner so far. The paper reviews some of the BIM-related technologies which could effectively support client and end-user involvement in the briefing process. Four main types of information technologies are considered and grouped as (1) rule-based validation tools (i.e. briefing software; rule-based model checking) and (2) simulation-based validation tools (i.e. gamification, immersive virtual environments). Those technologies are analysed and compared in order to identify what has already been done, possible future trends, evaluate their integration in the briefing process and, finally, take into account both their advantages and disadvantages in supporting the effective involvement of the demand-side of construction in digitally-enabled processes."],"creator_personal":[{"name":"Ventura, Silvia Mastrolembo"},{"name":"Ciribini, Angelo L.

The following pedagogical frameworks are explored: (a) Integrated Design and Delivery Solutions (IDDS), (b) Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK), and (c) Trinity of BIM as building information model/ -modelling/ -management (BIM3P). BIM-related methods are connected to the pedagogical framework to illustrate applicable implementation.

{"abstract":["Interoperability is a key factor for BIM and helps to simplify the communication and the cooperation between different actors during the project life-cycle. IFC appears as the best option to exchange data between different software platforms. The purpose of this paper is to offer a proposal for exchanging data by merging IFC-based BIM models. We consider a BIM project model like a large system of multi modules where each part represents a structure (building, road, bridge and tunnel) and should be completed by an IFC model. This article presents a numerical tool which allows the co-design step through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) developed in Java language using the IfcToolsProjects libraries. This work is situated in non-automatic merging models being problematic. The proposal is clearly a co-design assistance. This Interface allows the merging of many buildings represented by different IFC files and produces a new IFC-based buildings complex model. The result is fully exploitable without any data loss.

{"abstract":["This article highlights the advantages of Lean Construction (‘Lean') and Building Information Modelling ('BIM') that have received much attention. Individually, each promises transformative and beneficial effects on the construction process, prompting researchers to consider the possibility of synergies between the two. An early example is the hypothetical ‘Lean-BIM Interaction Matrix' of Rafael Sacks and his collaborators. In this, Lean principles are set against BIM functionality and synergies predicted. Early tests of the proposals were through retrospective case studies. Further promising results have been demonstrated in construction projects in the USA. This suggests that similar results might be possible elsewhere, prompting the present UK study. The methodological approach is case-study based on projects where the contractor purports to be using (i) Lean principles, (ii) BIM, and (iii) both. Evidence will be collected through a variety of means (including interviews, documents, and observation).

To do this an online questionnaire survey and face to face interviews were conducted to identify NHS FM professionals' awareness, understanding, experience, and opinions of BIM and organisational readiness. Analysis of the primary data shows that NHS FM professionals are underprepared to engage fully with BIM in a competent manner with many failing to demonstrate knowledge of the fundamental principles of BIM.

{"abstract":["BIM usage is accelerating rapidly across the globe, driven by the major private and government owners who want to embrace the benefits of faster, more certain project outcomes. The support of central government for BIM implementation can be regarded as the key driving force leading to higher utilisation of BIM. To further understand how international governments have supported their BIM programmes, the BIM Innovation Capability Programme (BICP) research team in Ireland completed a comprehensive Global BIM Study in 2017. An explicit ingredient of this article involved conducting a comprehensive literature review of global BIM adoption initiatives, with a particular focus on successful enablers in international regions. This helped inform the publication of the Digital Transition Roadmap published by the National BIM Council (NBC) of Ireland in late 2017. This article details the findings of an examination of BIM progress in eight countries of particular interest to the NBC given their relative advancement in their BIM journey. Whilst the results showed a variation of approach, evidence suggests that this was best achieved through the establishment of a central resource funded by government to drive digital transition. This article is particularly timely as Ireland releases its own Digital Construction Transition Roadmap 2018-2021. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how Ireland's Roadmap reflects best international practice and why international knowledge sharing and collaboration will be an ongoing priority for Ireland's transition programme."],"creator_personal":[{"name":"McAuley, Barry"},{"name":"Hore, Alan V."},{"name":"West, Roger"}],"date":2017,"econbiz_created":"2019-08-15T12:15:10Z","econbiz_id":"10012042522","identifier_doi":["10.4018/IJ3DIM.2017100101"],"identifier_url":["http://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx?doi=10.4018/IJ3DIM.2017100101"],"isPartOf":[{"day":"01","epage":"15","issn":["2156-1702","2156-1710"],"issue":"4","month":"10","pages":"1-15","spage":"1","title":"International Journal of 3-D Information Modeling (IJ3DIM)","volume":"6","year":"2017","zdb_id":"2695770-X"}],"language":["eng"],"open_access":0,"source_id":"igiglobal-10.4018/IJ3DIM.2017100101","source_name":"zbw-res","subject_byAuthor":["Building Information Modelling","Collaboration","Digital","Ireland"],"title":"Establishing Lessons for Ireland's BIM Policy Through a Systematic Review of International BIM Programmes","type":"article"}
{"abstract":["The authors have developed a novel methodology for utilising open standards for the reporting and correction of IFC-formatted BIMs during comprehensive dimensional control compliance. As designed BIMs rarely match exactly what was built on-site, and traditional methods for ensuring the design matches the built environment are tedious, costly, and time-consuming as stakeholders must manually navigate through the model to find problems, relying on subjective judgement. An efficient method to develop accurate as-built/as-is BIMs is by comparing point cloud reality capture data against the as-designed BIM to reflect the real-world state. The authors' novel methodology performs an automated comparison between as-built and as-designed representations, and employs the open standard BIM Collaboration Format (BCF) in the communication and correction of issues to resolve to match the true state of the built environment. Our methodology produces BCF reports containing recognised deviations between the as-is state and as-designed BIM, supported by the major BIM authoring tools."],"creator_personal":[{"name":"Hyland, Neil"},{"name":"O'Keeffe, Shawn E."},{"name":"Brodie, Shane"}],"date":2017,"econbiz_created":"2019-08-15T12:15:10Z","econbiz_id":"10012042523","identifier_doi":["10.4018/IJ3DIM.2017100102"],"identifier_url":["http://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx?doi=10.4018/IJ3DIM.2017100102"],"isPartOf":[{"day":"01","epage":"36","issn":["2156-1702","2156-1710"],"issue":"4","month":"10","pages":"16-36","spage":"16","title":"International Journal of 3-D Information Modeling (IJ3DIM)","volume":"6","year":"2017","zdb_id":"2695770-X"}],"language":["eng"],"open_access":0,"source_id":"igiglobal-10.4018/IJ3DIM.2017100102","source_name":"zbw-res","subject_byAuthor":["BIM","BIM Collaboration Format","Dimensional Control","Industry Foundation Classes","Laser Scanning","Scan-vs-BIM","Validation","Verification"],"title":"Utilizing BCF and IFC for Automated Dimensional Compliance Control","type":"article"}

{"abstract":["Since 2016, the BIM Innovation Capability Programme (BICP) has captured the capability of the Irish construction industry and the higher education institutes response to the increased requirement for BIM on construction and engineering projects. One of the primary responsibilities of the BICP research team was to collate data to assist the National BIM Council of Ireland in the formulation of a National BIM Roadmap. To assist the council with this task, the BICP research team applied five macro BIM maturity conceptual models to assess Ireland's BIM maturity. The application of the models has helped identify the key policies' outputs and the macro maturity components that were used to identify deliverables within the now-published Irish roadmap. The results from the models were further utilised to develop a managing-complex-change matrix. The matrix has helped identify the necessary ingredients for a successful digital transformation programme for Ireland's construction industry for the period 2018-2021.

Past empirical studies have examined this relationship across different stock markets by either outlining the influence of only domestic factors or a few global variables. A recent phenomenon has been the shift of academic interest to the emerging economies to investigate this presumed linkage by focusing more on global factors due to the trend of globalization. The aim of this paper is therefore to examine the influence of only global macroeconomic factors upon stock returns in the emerging stock market of Pakistan. By employing Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), findings indicate that significant influence of the global macroeconomic factors of the international interest rates and the world price index is observed, which implies a gradual integration of KSE towards the global financial markets.

{"abstract":["The development and use of long-lived public goods involves more than one demographic generation, leaving the classic literature on voluntary provisions partially unfit to explain complex phenomena such as welfare systems, climate policies and major infrastructure projects. This paper proposes a model that explains how equilibrium is reached in a context where heterogeneity is linked to seniority and strategic interaction is finitely repeated. Within this model the case of intergeneration public goods production is explained using a redistribution rule that benefits the younger players, as a compensation for their inexperience. Experimental evidence shows that subjects who belong to low or middling marginal per capita return types are negatively affected by heterogeneity, whereas groups benefit from the presence of experienced subjects. More importantly, results show that becoming disadvantaged (lowering the marginal per capita return of individuals in time) has negative effects on the provision of public goods, if compared to a situation where the disadvantage is constant in time (same low marginal per capita return in time)."],"creator_personal":[{"name":"Baggio, Marianna"},{"name":"Mittone, Luigi"}],"date":2016,"econbiz_created":"2019-08-15T12:15:10Z","econbiz_id":"10012042539","identifier_doi":["10.4018/IJABE.2016100101"],"identifier_url":["http://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx?doi=10.4018/IJABE.2016100101"],"isPartOf":[{"day":"01","epage":"23","issn":["2160-9810","2160-9802"],"issue":"4","month":"10","pages":"1-23","spage":"1","title":"International Journal of Applied Behavioral Economics (IJABE)","volume":"5","year":"2016","zdb_id":"2696095-3"}],"language":["eng"],"open_access":0,"source_id":"igiglobal-10.4018/IJABE.2016100101","source_name":"zbw-res","subject_byAuthor":["Generations","Heterogeneity","Heterogeneous Marginal Per Capita Return","OLG","Public Goods"],"title":"Experience and History: An Experimental Approach to Generational Heterogeneity","type":"article"}

While playing par five holes, golfers who have been penalized because of a poor first shot are more likely to adopt an aggressive strategy for finishing the hole compared to their non-penalized rivals who are not feeling the burden of not meeting a preconceived reference score.

To test the hypotheses of the study, the study has used the tools of descriptive statistics, combined means, and correlation of the data. The results of the study show that status-quo-labelled (current) policies are preferred over a change of setting, but negatively phrased policies do not show this status quo (SQ) effect. The results also demonstrate that the default setting, or SQ, has enhanced a policy's rating and attractiveness over the free and active choice. If people have to choose a policy when there is no default available, they experience difficulty in choosing and it takes them more time.

{"abstract":["The New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme was gradually introduced from 2003 in China. This paper is based on a representative survey of 24 randomly selected township hospitals in Weifang prefecture over the period 2000-2008. Using a generalized form of differences-in-differences model, it aims to assess the effect of the reform on the utilization and income structure of the township hospitals. The estimations provide three main results linked to the effects of the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme on the behavior of the key stakeholders (households, health care providers and Health Bureau). Firstly, the reform had positive impacts on the utilization of township hospitals, particularly on the inpatient activity, but no significant impact on their income structure. Secondly, a decrease in the burden of hospitalization costs for households is suggested by the higher positive impact of the reform on the volume of inpatients in poor areas than in the other ones.

{"abstract":["While it is assumed that the alternative with a larger profit is preferred to that with a smaller profit according to the traditional cost-benefit (linear) model, it is demonstrated that the lower discount accompanied by a price of zero is preferred to the larger discount without a price of zero. This is called the zero-price effect. Using the decision making situation to choose from alternatives (A) and (B) below, the zero-price effect was discussed as a function of parameters higher price (aX (a>1)) and lower price (X) and the relationship between the zero-price and the discounted amount. (a-1)X = Z corresponds to the case where the discounted price in alternative (B) is equal to the price of zero (X) in alternative (A). (a-1)X>Z corresponds to the case where the discounted price in alternative (B) is larger than the price of zero (X) in alternative (A). Decision making to choose from alternatives (A) and (B): (A) A product of $X is obtained for free; (B) A product of $Y( = aX) is discounted and sold with the price of $Z. In this manner, it was explored whether the zero-price effect was universally observable as a function of lower price X, higher price Y(= aX) and the relationship between the zero-price X and the discounted amount Y-Z. When (a-1)X = Z, the zero-price effect was observed only for (a: large, X: large) and (a: large, X: small). When a was large, the zero-price effect was observed irrespective of the value of X. When a was small, the zero-price effect was not observed. The author's decision tended to deviate from rational behavior assumed in traditional economics for large values of a irrespective of X. The price of zero must be irrationally chosen due to the overestimation of price of zero or affect heuristic. When (a-1)X>Z, the zero-price effect was observed only for (a: large, X: small) and (a: small, X: small). When X was small, the zero-price effect was observed irrespective of the value of a. When X was large, the zero-price effect was not observed. The human's decision tended to deviate from rational behavior assumed in traditional economics for small values of X irrespective of the value of a. In this manner, it has been indicated that the zero-price effect is not necessarily observable and holds under limited conditions."],"creator_personal":[{"name":"Murata, Atsuo"}],"date":2017,"econbiz_created":"2019-08-15T12:15:10Z","econbiz_id":"10012042544","identifier_doi":["10.4018/IJABE.2017010103"],"identifier_url":["http://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx?doi=10.4018/IJABE.2017010103"],"isPartOf":[{"day":"01","epage":"46","issn":["2160-9810","2160-9802"],"issue":"1","month":"01","pages":"34-46","spage":"34","title":"International Journal of Applied Behavioral Economics (IJABE)","volume":"6","year":"2017","zdb_id":"2696095-3"}],"language":["eng"],"open_access":0,"source_id":"igiglobal-10.4018/IJABE.2017010103","source_name":"zbw-res","subject_byAuthor":["Affect Heuristic","Anchoring and Adjustment","Cognitive Bias","Decision Making","Economic Behavior","Irrational Behavior","Mapping Difficulty","Price of Zero","Social Norm"],"title":"Discussion on Human's Irrational Behavior to Price of Zero: Identification of Condition of Zero-Price Effect","type":"article"}
{"abstract":["The main aim of this paper is to empirically evaluate the role of three significant factors of the Prospect Theory: the S-shaped value function, the loss aversion, and the distortion of probability, in decision making. In order to do this, a general behavioral reward-risk model is firstly setup and an empirical evaluation about the role of each of these factor, separately and in interaction, on the optimal solutions of the problem follows. For the analysis, well known US equity portfolios consisting by stocks listed in NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ formed on investment style are employed. The findings indicate that agents differentiate their behavior according to their type of preferences and their loss aversion level but they seem to always prefer high positively skewed assets such as small and value stocks. The attractiveness of positively skewed assets is re-enforced when probability distortion is introduced in the model. The introduction of probability distortion also affects the optimal perspective values of the problem increasing significantly their magnitude. After that, results show that as loss aversion increases agents tend to follow more conservative strategies, with and without probability distortion, while the value functional form has also its role in the model; bounded value functions as the negative exponential function drives agents to more conservative behaviors while unbounded value functions as the piecewise power function give the incentive to agents to undertake great risks and follow more aggressive strategies. The examination of the interaction of these factors indicate that the combination of an unbounded value functional form with a large loss aversion index may reduce agents' aggressiveness and limit (but not alter) the value functional form effect on optimal solutions."],"creator_personal":[{"name":"Zervoudi, Evanthia K."}],"date":2017,"econbiz_created":"2019-08-15T12:15:10Z","econbiz_id":"10012042545","identifier_doi":["10.4018/IJABE.2017040101"],"identifier_url":["http://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx?doi=10.4018/IJABE.2017040101"],"isPartOf":[{"day":"01","epage":"22","issn":["2160-9810","2160-9802"],"issue":"2","month":"04","pages":"1-22","spage":"1","title":"International Journal of Applied Behavioral Economics (IJABE)","volume":"6","year":"2017","zdb_id":"2696095-3"}],"language":["eng"],"open_access":0,"source_id":"igiglobal-10.4018/IJABE.2017040101","source_name":"zbw-res","subject_byAuthor":["Behavioral Portfolio Optimization","Loss Aversion","Probability Distortion","Prospect Theory","S-Shaped Value Function"],"title":"Evaluating the Role of Three Basic Factors of Prospect Theory in Decision Making: An Empirical Study","type":"article"}
{"abstract":["Guessing games are often used in the behavioral economics literature to investigate the rationality of economic agents. In this paper, the author uses a typical guessing game to examine not only the rationality of the test subjects but also the degree of their strategic uncertainty in playing the guessing game. A typically negative relationship was found between the frequency and the degree of strategic uncertainty, measured by proxy using the test subjects' guesses as to the standard deviation of all test subjects' answers regarding selection of a number from a specified interval. The role and effects of a public common noise player in the guessing game were investigated, which showed that the existence of such a player, even when he/she is not rational, can decrease the variance of the answered values and the degree of strategic uncertainty. These findings imply that the existence of a public common noisy player who is not necessarily rational can provide an anchoring focal point in the guessing game under uncertainty and that this player can be an influential coordinator. This implication would be useful in explaining possible bubbles or booms/bursts, collective short sales such as currency attacks in markets, or other real-world economic and business anomalies."],"creator_personal":[{"name":"Kasahara, Tetsuya"}],"date":2017,"econbiz_created":"2019-08-15T12:15:10Z","econbiz_id":"10012042546","identifier_doi":["10.4018/IJABE.2017040102"],"identifier_url":["http://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx?doi=10.4018/IJABE.2017040102"],"isPartOf":[{"day":"01","epage":"36","issn":["2160-9810","2160-9802"],"issue":"2","month":"04","pages":"23-36","spage":"23","title":"International Journal of Applied Behavioral Economics (IJABE)","volume":"6","year":"2017","zdb_id":"2696095-3"}],"language":["eng"],"open_access":0,"source_id":"igiglobal-10.4018/IJABE.2017040102","source_name":"zbw-res","subject_byAuthor":["Bounded Rationality","Coordination Games","Focal Point","Guessing Games","Public Common Noise Players","Strategic Uncertainty"],"title":"Strategic Uncertainty in the Guessing Game and the Role and Effects of a Public Common Noise Player","type":"article"}

This effectively requires challenging the rationale underlying private financial flows that are driven by short-term profits and rents, and strengthening mechanisms for mobilizing and allocating both domestic and external finance for value creation and development over a longer time horizon.

{"abstract":["This research aims to extend the literature on stress by exploring the relationship between incivility and employees' counterproductive work behavior (CWB). We investigate the mediating role of psychological distress (PD) to understand the relationship of family and workplace incivility with CWB. The study also evaluates the moderation effect of emotional regulation between incivility and PD. Analysis of three-wave lagged data (N=328), collected from bank employees in Pakistan, indicates that PD mediates the effect of family and workplace incivility on CWB and emotional regulation moderates the effect of family and workplace incivility on PD. Our findings highlight the fact that emotional regulation and PD are important mechanisms in the incivility–CWB relationship. The inclusion of these two constructs is a key to understanding the relationships among family incivility, workplace incivility, and work-related outcomes.

{"abstract":["In this manuscript, the author proposes a model that constitutes a generalization of the El Farol Bar problem. In this model, in each period, each one of the n agents decides the arrival time at a theatre with free entry in which there are k (k<n) seats. Each individual wants to minimize the waiting time (before the beginning of the show) but prefers to assist to the show comfortably seated. The author introduces a utility function that takes into account these aspects, in which also agents' heterogeneity, in terms of different patience or comfort preferences, is considered. The author examines some possible approaches to this problem, and provides a new inductive reasoning modeling for a simplified version of this Theatre Attendance model, according to which each agent decides the arrival time at the theatre in a certain period by looking at the outcome of the previous round."],"creator_personal":[{"name":"Bisceglia, Michele"}],"date":2017,"econbiz_created":"2019-08-15T12:15:10Z","econbiz_id":"10012042550","identifier_doi":["10.4018/IJABE.2017070102"],"identifier_url":["http://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx?doi=10.4018/IJABE.2017070102"],"isPartOf":[{"day":"01","epage":"38","issn":["2160-9810","2160-9802"],"issue":"3","month":"07","pages":"23-38","spage":"23","title":"International Journal of Applied Behavioral Economics (IJABE)","volume":"6","year":"2017","zdb_id":"2696095-3"}],"language":["eng"],"open_access":0,"source_id":"igiglobal-10.4018/IJABE.2017070102","source_name":"zbw-res","subject_byAuthor":["Agents' Heterogeneity","Bounded Rationality","El Farol Bar Problem","Inductive Reasoning","Utility Function"],"title":"A Theatre Attendance Model","type":"article"}
{"abstract":["Marketing literature provides empirical evidence on the relationship among corporate social responsibility (CSR), company identification, emotional attachment, corporate image and consumer behavior. However, there is sparse research that examines the impact of CSR, image, identity and emotional attachment in shaping investors' behavior. The current study fills this gap by proposing and testing a conceptual model that examines the nexus between CSR, company identification, emotional attachment and corporate image and investor behavior. Data has been collected from small equity investors trading at Lahore Stock Exchange in Pakistan using self-administered survey questionnaire technique. The study used structural equation modeling (SEM) technique to test the proposed model. The study found positive association between CSR, and corporate image, corporate identity and development of emotional attachment with company. The higher level of CSR, corporate image, corporate identity and emotional attachment leads to development of investors' behavioral loyalty with company."],"creator_personal":[{"name":"Ali, Imran"}],"date":2017,"econbiz_created":"2019-08-15T12:15:10Z","econbiz_id":"10012042551","identifier_doi":["10.4018/IJABE.2017070103"],"identifier_url":["http://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx?doi=10.4018/IJABE.2017070103"],"isPartOf":[{"day":"01","epage":"52","issn":["2160-9810","2160-9802"],"issue":"3","month":"07","pages":"39-52","spage":"39","title":"International Journal of Applied Behavioral Economics (IJABE)","volume":"6","year":"2017","zdb_id":"2696095-3"}],"language":["eng"],"open_access":0,"source_id":"igiglobal-10.4018/IJABE.2017070103","source_name":"zbw-res","subject_byAuthor":["Company Identification","Corporate Image","Corporate Social Responsibility","Emotional Attachment","Investor Behavior"],"title":"The Nexus Between CSR, Corporate Image, Company Identification, Emotional Attachment and Small Equity Investors Behavior","type":"article"}

The authors thus investigate a reframed version of the gift-exchange game in which the firms' payoffs can take two values, one of them is randomly determined by an external process after the effort choice has been made. They find that effort levels are significantly lower when payoffs are probabilistic than when they are deterministic. As a consequence, high waging is profitable in the deterministic, but not in the probabilistic condition.

In a longitudinal experiment, where manipulating the complexity of the decision context through marketing analytics, the authors demonstrate that managers employing simple marketing analytics expect their competitors to launch more products, compared to managers using complex marketing analytics.

The empirical evidence suggests that student attention is substantially discounted in an online learning environment as evidenced by the much lower-than-expected log-on minutes. Students do not seem to treat online courses as equivalent to their traditional on-site counterparts.

{"abstract":["Measuring the impact of self-control on caloric intake has proved challenging in non-experimental studies. In this article, we study the relationship between self-control and food intake quantified by calories. Using validated behavioral measures, we find that impulsivity increases caloric intake, and that restraint decreases intake. Furthermore, the effect of impulsivity and restraint is more pronounced at the upper end of the calorie distribution. Thus, individuals already consuming more calories display a heightened reaction and likelihood to succumb to food environmental pressures. An individual's decision to diet, when allowed to vary with behavioral measures, bears no unique significance on caloric intake.

{"abstract":["The main objective of this study was to examine the likelihood of household savings in relation to their characteristics, and analyze whether households move to upper level in hierarchy of saving motives as described in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory. This research used primary data by using a questionnaire with six categories of saving motives—daily expenses, emergency motives, major purchases, retirement, children, and investment. Multinomial logistic regression was used to test the relationship between household characteristics and saving motives. The results indicate that households with different characteristics save for different motives, and a change in household characteristics causes movement in the hierarchy of saving motives. Lower income households save for lower level needs i.e. daily expenses, while high income households save for higher needs such as investment. Savings for children was reported as the most important saving motive and existed in almost all income groups.

{"abstract":["Social peace is an asset to every society. Its absence endangers the well-being and the safety of the population and the stability of states. In order to better understand the interdependencies of poverty, social peace and migration pressure the authors introduce the model of the “Edgeworth-Cube” which is an extension of the classical Edgeworth Box model by one dimension. This new dimension can either be interpreted as “aggression” (which reduces “social peace” for others) or as “migration pressure” (which results from a worldwide heterogeneous distribution of wealth), and this new dimension is modelled as a non-budget-constrained unilateral immaterial good. The “Edgeworth-Cube” also differentiates vital (essential) goods from normal (non-essential) goods. By focusing on extremely imbalanced endowments and by formal mathematical modeling the authors show in their approach that applying behavioral pressure (i.e. aggression or migration pressure) has an existential economic value for the poor on the one hand. On the other hand, the authors show that transfer payments have a systemically limited potential to keep aggression and migration pressure at bay."],"creator_personal":[{"name":"Kunze, Oliver"},{"name":"Schlatterer, Florian"}],"date":2018,"econbiz_created":"2019-08-15T12:15:10Z","econbiz_id":"10012042560","identifier_doi":["10.4018/IJABE.2018040103"],"identifier_url":["http://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx?doi=10.4018/IJABE.2018040103"],"isPartOf":[{"day":"01","epage":"46","issn":["2160-9810","2160-9802"],"issue":"2","month":"04","pages":"30-46","spage":"30","title":"International Journal of Applied Behavioral Economics (IJABE)","volume":"7","year":"2018","zdb_id":"2696095-3"}],"language":["eng"],"open_access":0,"source_id":"igiglobal-10.4018/IJABE.2018040103","source_name":"zbw-res","subject_byAuthor":["Aggression","Conflict Economics","JEL Classification Codes: D51","D61","D62","H53","H55","K37","K42","Pareto Efficient Allocations","Social Peace","Transfers"],"title":"The Edgeworth Cube: An Economic Model for Social Peace","type":"article"}

{"abstract":["Collaboration in R&D has had a positive influence on the performance of firms, but little is known about its impact on organizational innovation. Therefore, this article analyzes the influence of R&D collaboration on firms' ability to introduce organizational innovation. A quantitative approach was used, based on a sample of 5.079 Portuguese firms from the CIS 2010-Community Innovation Survey 2010. The empirical evidence showed R&D collaboration with clients to be predominant in organizational innovation adoption. Cooperation with competitors, universities and state laboratories has no significant influence.

{"abstract":["This article tests the effectiveness of commitment devices on weight loss. It can be applied as a health ‘nudge' that locks in future behaviours to achieve a desired health outcome, by staking money or reputation on achieving that goal. A field experiment randomly assigned 364 clients of an online weight loss service to either a reputational commitment device or an upfront refund on the monthly fee. The reputational commitment intervention was expected to combat time inconsistency and promote greater weight loss. Weight outcomes were measured at 12 weeks. The results showed that all experimental groups lost weight on average, but the group experiencing the reputational commitment reported end weight outcomes 1.5 kg higher than the comparison group, indicating slower weight loss (± 0.05, effect size -0.32). One possible explanation for the findings is ‘commitment overload'.

{"abstract":["Role of institutional owners is becoming vital regarding strategic decision making in modern day business corporations. Financial institutions are capable to monitor the empowered company insiders and to regulate the capital market positioning of firms due to their specialized expertise and low cost of monitoring the managers. This article is an attempt to investigate the role of institutional owners on firms' risk-taking behavior in an emerging market. By using the sample of 58 non-financial firms listed at Karachi Stock Exchane-100 (KSE-100) index for a period of 2010 to 2017, these results revealed that institutional ownership can influence firms risk taking decisions. This influence depends on type of institutional ownership; passive owners play negative role in risk taking while active owners play a positive role in risk taking.

{"abstract":["Time discounting factors represent a widely-discussed subject in economics. Several methods are employed in order to collect data on discounting behavior; one of the most popular, also used in this article, is Kirby's Monetary Choice Questionnaire (MCQ). The binary responses in the questionnaire are then processed in order to estimate the k parameters of delay discounting. Two methods of estimation are compared and evaluated – Kaplan's Autoscorer and Wileyto's Logistic Regression Model. Rohrmann's Risk Orientation Questionnaire uses participants' responses to quantify the manifestation of risk related behaviors. In the final analysis of this article, the logistic regression estimates of k and the risk orientation factors are taken into consideration, together with demographic variables, to check for correlations and trends. There were no significant links found between risk orientation and time-discounting. However, there were several significant results at demographic level – for example, a positive correlation of 0.166 between risk aversion and income level during childhood (p = 0.02)."],"creator_personal":[{"name":"Tigau, Horia Daniel"}],"date":2018,"econbiz_created":"2019-08-15T12:15:10Z","econbiz_id":"10012042567","identifier_doi":["10.4018/IJABE.2018100103"],"identifier_url":["http://services.igi-global.com/resolvedoi/resolve.aspx?doi=10.4018/IJABE.2018100103"],"isPartOf":[{"day":"01","epage":"53","issn":["2160-9810","2160-9802"],"issue":"4","month":"10","pages":"37-53","spage":"37","title":"International Journal of Applied Behavioral Economics (IJABE)","volume":"7","year":"2018","zdb_id":"2696095-3"}],"language":["eng"],"open_access":0,"source_id":"igiglobal-10.4018/IJABE.2018100103","source_name":"zbw-res","subject_byAuthor":["Childhood Income","Factor Analysis","Kirby’s Questionnaire","Rohrmann’s ROQ","Wyleito Logistic Regression"],"title":"Analysing the Relationship Between Personal Time Discounting Factors and Risk Related Behaviour","type":"article"}

{"abstract":["Many past studies documented a strong evidence of a linkage between stock prices and macroeconomic activities across different stock markets and time horizons. However, most of these studies have focused on developed economies and highlighted the impact of either domestic variables or a few global factors. In recent times, the impact of global macroeconomic factors upon stock returns has garnered a lot of interest due to globalization. The aim of this paper is therefore to examine the combined influence of global and domestic macroeconomic factors upon stock returns and extend this relationship to an emerging market of Bangladesh. Using Vector Autoregression (VAR) model, findings indicate a considerable impact of money supply for the stock returns of Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE). Additionally, an insignificant influence of the world price index is observed, which implies a complete segmentation of DSE from the global financial markets.

Authenticity played a wide role in tourist experiences and repeat business for the destination. Commodification on the other hand is a byproduct of making the events authentic in order for it to be presented to the tourists since these events cannot be presented in its original form or length.

However, given limited and competing use of resources, raising agricultural productivity is of paramount importance. To date, most of the existing work on Indonesia's agricultural sector is at the national level. Considering the extent of Indonesia's regional diversity, a provincial-level analysis of the country's agricultural sector would be more useful from a policy perspective. In this light, this paper examines agricultural productivity growth in Indonesian provinces during 2000-2011 and draws policy implications from such empirical analysis.

Compared to customers in Europe and North America, generally speaking, most of Chinese customers have lower knowledge about the product, and then have lower beliefs and intention to adopt or purchase the new IT product.

However, previous studies do not clearly discuss the effect of consumers' beliefs about product after product trial.

{"abstract":["Due to increased globalization and economic integration in the global economy, contagion effects have been considered an important matter for the investors and policymakers. In the wake of the global financial crisis of September 2008, Islamic financial products were thrust into the spotlight as alternatives to the shaken conventional equity markets. The objective of this study is to discover the Islamic stock market dynamics of Bangladesh with the global Islamic stock markets such as Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, Europe, UK and Japan. For understanding long run relationship or the theoretical relationships among the Islamic stock market and short run co-movements among Islamic stocks, Johansen co-integration test and Vector Error Correction model (VECM) have been applied respectively. Furthermore, the investigation on short run dynamics is also carried through Impulse Response Function (IRF) analyses. The study found that the Japanese Islamic Stock market is affected to changes in other Islamic stock markets while Kuwait stock market is the leader in the sense it affects other stock market greatly. Bangladeshi Islamic stock market is found to be marginally affecting other stock markets but not as strong as Kuwait. Global Islamic stock market seems to have very little impact to Bangladesh Islamic stock market. The evidence of co-integration and short run dynamics help a diversification benefit may be derived from the cross boarder investment. The empirical evidence of co-integration and short run dynamic relationship found in this study will help investors in making efficient investment decisions and also enhance their understanding of market behavior."],"creator_personal":[{"name":"Chowdhury, Mohammad Ashraful Ferdous"},{"name":"Haque, Md.

Complementary concepts such as the global value chain point out that strong clusters benefit from strong external linkages and are well positioned to take advantage of them. Although there is still less evidence on the role and impact of cluster approach for entrepreneurship development, the experience and the conceptual framework suggest otherwise. Clusters can enhance the rate of entrepreneurship development and there are different ways to raise economic benefits for entrepreneurs from existing clusters.
